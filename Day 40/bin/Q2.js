// Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.
// Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true. It’s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log("Hello World.");
    i++;
}
