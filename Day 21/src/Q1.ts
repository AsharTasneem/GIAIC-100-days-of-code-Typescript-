// Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

// Explain & TIP: Enums are like special lists in your code that help you categorize things. They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.
enum vehicle{
    bike = "Bike",
    car = "Car",
    truck = "Truck",
    bus = "Bus",
}

console.log(vehicle.car)
