// List three reserved words in JavaScript and create a valid use case for each.

// Explain & TIP: Reserved words in JavaScript are words that have a special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names). Understanding these can help prevent syntax errors and make your code more readable.

// Reserved word: let - used to declare a block-scoped local variable
let count = 5;

// Reserved word: if - used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true
if (count > 0) {
  console.log("Count is greater than 0.");
}

function add(a : number, b : number) {
  return a + b;
}
